App Design Document: Project "Find My File"
Document Version: 5.0 (Revised)

Project Lead: Sumanth

1. Vision & Executive Summary
High Concept: "Find My File" is a smart, private, offline semantic search engine for Android that allows users to find files based on their content and context using natural language.

Target Platform: Android.

Target Audience: All Android users who need a powerful and intuitive way to search their local files without compromising their privacy.

Unique Selling Proposition (USP): The application combines a powerful Google ML Kit-based indexing engine with a sophisticated Mobile BERT model that translates human language into precise, content-aware search queries, all while working completely offline.

2. Core Application Feature: The Intelligence Engine
To maintain a minimal app size (under 50MB) and focus on a single, high-quality feature, "Find My File" is dedicated exclusively to search. 
Background Indexing Service: A lightweight background process scans user folders to build a rich, local search database. It uses a defined set of libraries to extract meaningful keywords, text, and metadata from each file.

Natural Language Search Bar: The app's primary interface is a search bar that accepts natural language queries (e.g., "show me photos from my trip last summer" or "find the report I downloaded last week").

Mobile BERT Query Processing: User queries are processed by a fine-tuned, 25MB quantized Mobile BERT model. This model acts as an "intent translator," converting the user's conversational language into a structured query (containing keywords, time-scapes, file types) that can be used to search the indexed database with high accuracy.

3. File Processing & Indexing Strategy
The app will support a wide range of common file types, each handled by a specialized, high-performance library.

Technical Architecture & Stack
Core Framework: Flutter (using Dart).

Architecture Principle: 100% Offline & Private. No data ever leaves the user's device.

Core Constraint: Total application size must be kept under 50MB.
